{"resume_id": "R-4", "name": "Arjun Mehta", "summary": "Principal backend engineer with deep experience designing large-scale distributed systems, high-throughput APIs, and cloud-native platforms. Strong focus on system design, performance optimization, and mentoring senior engineers.", "total_experience": 14.0, "relevant_experience": 0.0, "highest_education": "B.Tech in Computer Science", "relevant_education": "Yes", "matching_skills": ["PostgreSQL", "AWS", "Kubernetes"], "missing_skills": ["Java Development", "IAM Expertise", "Security Protocols", "RESTful APIs", "Databases", "Version Control", "CI/CD"], "recommendation": "Not Recommended", "reasoning": "The candidate, Arjun Mehta, has extensive experience as a Principal Backend Engineer with a strong background in system design and cloud-native platforms. However, the job description specifically requires expertise in Java development and Identity and Access Management (IAM), which the candidate lacks. There is no evidence in the resume that suggests hands-on experience with Java or IAM tools, security protocols, and related IAM solutions. While the candidate has relevant educational qualifications, the mismatch in core skills and required experience for the Java Developer position leads to a recommendation of 'Not Recommended.'"}
