{"resume_id": "R-13", "name": "Laura Martin", "summary": "Data scientist working on predictive models.", "total_experience": 6.0, "relevant_experience": 0.0, "highest_education": "M.Sc in Data Science", "relevant_education": "No", "matching_skills": ["SQL"], "missing_skills": ["Java Development", "IAM Expertise", "Security Protocols", "RESTful APIs", "Databases", "Version Control", "CI/CD"], "recommendation": "Not Recommended", "reasoning": "Laura Martin has a total of 6 years of experience as a data scientist, which does not align with the job requirements of a Java Developer position in Identity and Access Management (IAM). While she has relevant skills in SQL and experience with predictive models, she lacks the required skills in Java development, IAM solutions, and security protocols. The educational background in Data Science is not relevant for a position necessitating a degree in Computer Science or related fields. Overall, given the significant mismatch between her qualifications and the job description, she is not recommended for this role."}
