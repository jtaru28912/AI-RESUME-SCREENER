{"resume_id": "R-5", "name": "Arjun Nair", "summary": "Highly experienced backend engineer.", "total_experience": 10.0, "relevant_experience": 0.0, "highest_education": "B.Tech in Computer Science", "relevant_education": "Yes", "matching_skills": ["PostgreSQL"], "missing_skills": ["Java Development", "IAM Expertise", "Security Protocols", "RESTful APIs", "Databases", "Version Control", "CI/CD"], "recommendation": "Not Recommended", "reasoning": "While Arjun Nair has extensive experience as a backend engineer and holds a relevant degree, he lacks the key qualifications needed for the Java Developer position focused on Identity and Access Management (IAM). The job requires specific Java programming skills, hands-on experience with IAM solutions, and a solid understanding of security protocols that he does not possess. Additionally, his experience does not align with the required 3-6 years for this role, nor does it highlight any relevant skills that match the job description. Thus, he is not a strong fit for this position."}
