The role heavily focuses on IAM solutions and strong Java development skills that the candidate does not possess. Furthermore, the candidate's educational background, while relevant for security roles, does not meet the preferences set forth in the job description for degrees related to Computer Science or IT. Overall, while the candidate has strong security experience, he lacks the necessary skills and relevant experience for this particular position."}
