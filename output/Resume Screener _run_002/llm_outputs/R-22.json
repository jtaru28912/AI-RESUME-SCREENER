With 3+ years in the field, he has demonstrated expertise in Java and Spring Boot, alongside hands-on experience with IAM tools such as Okta. However, the candidate lacks experience with some IAM solutions and security protocols explicitly mentioned in the job description, such as ForgeRock, Ping Identity, and SAML, which are essential for this role. Therefore, while I would recommend him for the position, I suggest emphasizing the need for further development in the specified areas to fully meet the job requirements."}
