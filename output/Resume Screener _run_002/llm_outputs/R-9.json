{"resume_id": "R-9", "name": "Fatima Khan", "summary": "AI engineer with focus on NLP applications.", "total_experience": 4.0, "relevant_experience": 0.0, "highest_education": "M.Sc in AI", "relevant_education": "No", "matching_skills": ["Python", "NLP"], "missing_skills": ["Java Development", "IAM Expertise", "Security Protocols", "RESTful APIs", "Databases", "Version Control", "CI/CD"], "recommendation": "Not Recommended", "reasoning": "Fatima Khan has 4 years of experience as an AI Engineer, primarily focusing on NLP applications, which does not align with the job description for a Java Developer specializing in Identity and Access Management (IAM). The job requires strong Java skills and expertise in IAM solutions, security protocols, and related technologies, none of which are present in her skill set. Her educational background in AI does not meet the specified requirements for relevant computer science or IT degrees either. Additionally, Fatima's experience in Python and NLP is not relevant to the Java development and IAM focus outlined in the job description."}
