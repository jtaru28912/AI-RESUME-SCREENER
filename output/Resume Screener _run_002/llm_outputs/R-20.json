{"resume_id": "R-20", "name": "Pooja Mehra", "summary": "QA engineer focused on automation testing.", "total_experience": 6.0, "relevant_experience": 0.0, "highest_education": "B.Tech in IT", "relevant_education": "No", "matching_skills": [], "missing_skills": ["Core Java", "Spring Boot", "Hibernate", "IAM Solutions", "OAuth 2.0", "OpenID Connect", "SAML", "JWT", "LDAP", "Active Directory", "RESTful APIs", "SQL", "NoSQL", "Version Control", "CI/CD", "IAM Certifications"], "recommendation": "Not Recommended", "reasoning": "Pooja Mehra has a solid background as a QA engineer with extensive experience in automation testing and skills in Python and Selenium. However, the job description for the Java Developer role requests specific skills in Java development, IAM solutions, and various security protocols that are not found in Pooja's resume. The candidate\u2019s focus on QA automation does not align with the requirements of a role that emphasizes Java programming and IAM expertise. Therefore, I would recommend not moving forward with this candidate."}
