{"resume_id": "R-16", "name": "Neha Kapoor", "summary": "Senior backend engineer with cloud and microservices experience.", "total_experience": 8.0, "relevant_experience": 0.0, "highest_education": "B.Tech in Computer Engineering", "relevant_education": "Yes", "matching_skills": ["PostgreSQL", "AWS", "Kubernetes"], "missing_skills": ["Java Development", "IAM Expertise", "Security Protocols", "RESTful APIs", "Version Control", "CI/CD"], "recommendation": "Not Recommended", "reasoning": "While Neha has substantial experience as a backend engineer and expertise in technologies such as PostgreSQL, AWS, and Kubernetes, her skills do not align with the requirements of the Java Developer role focused on Identity and Access Management (IAM). The job requires strong Java development, IAM solutions expertise, knowledge of security protocols, and experience in handling APIs, none of which are present in her background. The mismatch in relevant experience and skill set leads to a recommendation against her for this particular position."}
