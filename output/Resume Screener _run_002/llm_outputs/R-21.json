She exhibits solid knowledge of backend development, including RESTful APIs and relevant database technologies such as PostgreSQL. However, she lacks experience with some key IAM tools (ForgeRock, Ping Identity, SailPoint) and specific security protocols like OAuth 2.0 and SAML, which are essential for the role. If she is willing to upskill in these areas, she could be a strong asset to the team."}
