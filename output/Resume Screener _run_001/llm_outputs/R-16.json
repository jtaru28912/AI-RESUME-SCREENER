However, she lacks specific experience in key areas such as OpenAI APIs, prompt engineering, and certain advanced backend system design principles that are crucial for the Senior GenAI Backend Engineer role. While she has relevant education and experience, the missing skills indicate a potential learning curve for this specific role. Therefore, she is recommended for consideration, but may require additional training or support to fully meet the expectations of the position."}
