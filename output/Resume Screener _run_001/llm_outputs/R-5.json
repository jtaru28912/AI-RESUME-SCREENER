{"resume_id": "R-5", "name": "Arjun Nair", "summary": "Highly experienced backend engineer.", "total_experience": 10.0, "relevant_experience": 10.0, "highest_education": "B.Tech in Computer Science", "relevant_education": "Yes", "matching_skills": ["Python", "FastAPI", "System Design", "Django"], "missing_skills": ["Experience with OpenAI APIs or similar LLM providers", "Experience with prompt engineering and structured outputs", "Familiarity with Pydantic or schema-based validation", "Experience with RAG systems and vector databases", "Familiarity with LangChain or similar orchestration frameworks", "Experience with async programming (AsyncIO)", "Experience with Docker / Kubernetes", "Exposure to LLM evaluation and monitoring"], "recommendation": "Recommended", "reasoning": "Arjun Nair has a solid foundation in backend engineering with 10 years of experience, including skills that align well with the job description such as Python, FastAPI, and System Design. However, he lacks direct experience with OpenAI APIs, prompt engineering, and other specific LLM-related technologies that are important for the Senior GenAI Backend Engineer role. While he is qualified for backend tasks, the specific requirements for GenAI applications may be a challenge. Thus, a recommendation of 'Recommended' reflects that while he is a strong candidate, he may need to upskill in certain areas to fully meet the role's demands."}
