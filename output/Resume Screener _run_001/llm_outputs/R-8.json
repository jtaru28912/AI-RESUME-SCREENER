{"resume_id": "R-8", "name": "Farah Ali", "summary": "AI specialist working on NLP and ML solutions for healthcare and life sciences.", "total_experience": 10.0, "relevant_experience": 5.0, "highest_education": "PhD in Biomedical Informatics", "relevant_education": "No", "matching_skills": ["Python", "OpenAI API"], "missing_skills": ["Experience with FastAPI / Django", "Hands-on experience with LLM providers", "Experience with prompt engineering and structured outputs", "Experience building scalable backend systems", "Strong understanding of system design and API architecture"], "recommendation": "Not Recommended", "reasoning": "While Farah Ali has substantial experience in AI, particularly in NLP and machine learning, her background is primarily focused on healthcare applications rather than backend engineering for GenAI systems. The job description specifically requires strong backend engineering fundamentals and experience with FastAPI, LLM systems, and scalable backend solutions, which are not reflected in her resume. Additionally, although she has experience with Python and OpenAI APIs, the lack of relevant backend experience in building production-grade systems and required frameworks suggests she is not a suitable fit for the role."}
