{"resume_id": "R-7", "name": "Emily Roberts", "summary": "Product manager with technical background.", "total_experience": 7.0, "relevant_experience": 0.0, "highest_education": "MBA", "relevant_education": "No", "matching_skills": ["Product Strategy", "SQL", "Python (basic)", "Analytics"], "missing_skills": ["Strong proficiency in Python", "Experience with FastAPI / Django", "Hands-on experience with OpenAI APIs or similar LLM providers", "Experience with prompt engineering and structured outputs", "Familiarity with Pydantic or schema-based validation", "Experience building scalable backend systems", "Strong understanding of system design and API architecture"], "recommendation": "Not Recommended", "reasoning": "While Emily has a solid background in product management and relevant technical skills, her experience does not align with the requirements for the Senior GenAI Backend Engineer position. The role demands strong backend engineering expertise, including specific experience with Python in a production environment, REST API development, and LLM-based systems, none of which are evident from her resume. Consequently, she lacks the necessary skills and experience to succeed in this role."}
