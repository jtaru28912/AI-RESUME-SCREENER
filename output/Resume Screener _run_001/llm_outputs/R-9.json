{"resume_id": "R-9", "name": "Fatima Khan", "summary": "AI engineer with focus on NLP applications.", "total_experience": 4.0, "relevant_experience": 2.0, "highest_education": "M.Sc in AI", "relevant_education": "Yes", "matching_skills": ["Python", "OpenAI API", "NLP"], "missing_skills": ["FastAPI", "Django", "prompt engineering", "structured outputs", "Pydantic", "scalable backend systems", "system design", "API architecture", "RAG systems", "vector databases", "LangChain", "async programming", "Cloud experience", "Docker", "Kubernetes", "LLM evaluation and monitoring"], "recommendation": "Not Recommended", "reasoning": "While Fatima Khan has a solid foundation as an AI Engineer and relevant skills in Python, NLP, and OpenAI API, she falls short on key requirements specified in the job description for the Senior GenAI Backend Engineer role. She has only 4 years of overall experience and lacks the 5+ years required in backend or platform engineering, particularly in building scalable systems and using frameworks like FastAPI or Django. Her experience with LLM systems is limited, with only 2 years of specific relevance. Additionally, she does not have experience in critical areas such as prompt engineering, structured outputs, and backend systems architecture, which makes her a less suitable candidate for this position."}
