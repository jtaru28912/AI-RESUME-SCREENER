His skills in Python and FastAPI align well with the job requirements. However, he lacks specific experience with generative AI technologies and related frameworks, which are essential for the Senior GenAI Backend Engineer role. While he is a strong candidate with relevant backend experience, the missing skills related to LLMs and prompt engineering limit his fit for this specific position."}
