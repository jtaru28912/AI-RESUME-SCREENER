{"resume_id": "R-19", "name": "Olivia Brown", "summary": "Technical writer with engineering background.", "total_experience": 5.0, "relevant_experience": 0.0, "highest_education": "B.A. English", "relevant_education": "No", "matching_skills": ["Documentation"], "missing_skills": ["Python (strong proficiency)", "Experience with FastAPI / Django", "Hands-on experience with OpenAI APIs or similar LLM providers", "Experience with prompt engineering and structured outputs", "Familiarity with Pydantic or schema-based validation", "Experience building scalable backend systems", "Understanding of system design and API architecture", "Experience with RAG systems and vector databases", "Experience with async programming (AsyncIO)", "Cloud experience (AWS preferred)", "Experience with Docker / Kubernetes", "Experience with LLM evaluation and monitoring"], "recommendation": "Not Recommended", "reasoning": "Olivia Brown has 5 years of experience as a technical writer, which does not align with the requirements for a Senior GenAI Backend Engineer role. Her skills primarily revolve around documentation, with basic knowledge of Python, which is not sufficient for the backend engineering position that requires strong proficiency in Python and extensive experience with various backend frameworks and tools. Additionally, her educational background in English does not match the technical qualifications specified in the job description for a computer science or related field. Thus, she lacks the relevant experience and technical skills essential for this role."}
