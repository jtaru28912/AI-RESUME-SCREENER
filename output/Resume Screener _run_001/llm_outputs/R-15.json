{"resume_id": "R-15", "name": "Mohit Aggarwal", "summary": "Security engineer specializing in application and cloud security.", "total_experience": 11.0, "relevant_experience": 0.0, "highest_education": "B.Tech in Information Security", "relevant_education": "No", "matching_skills": ["Python", "Cloud Security"], "missing_skills": ["FastAPI", "Django", "OpenAI APIs or similar LLM providers", "prompt engineering", "Pydantic or schema-based validation", "scalable backend systems", "system design and API architecture", "RAG systems", "vector databases", "LangChain or similar orchestration frameworks", "async programming", "Docker", "Kubernetes"], "recommendation": "Not Recommended", "reasoning": "Although Mohit Aggarwal has significant experience as a security engineer, his skills and experience do not align with the requirements for the Senior GenAI Backend Engineer position. The role requires specialized backend engineering knowledge focused on AI-powered applications, including specific experience with FastAPI, OpenAI APIs, and prompt engineering which are not present in his resume. Furthermore, the candidate's primary experience centers around security rather than backend system design and implementation, making him unsuitable for this position."}
