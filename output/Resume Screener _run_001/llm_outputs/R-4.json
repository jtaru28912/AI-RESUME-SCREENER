{"resume_id": "R-4", "name": "Arjun Mehta", "summary": "Principal backend engineer with deep experience designing large-scale distributed systems, high-throughput APIs, and cloud-native platforms. Strong focus on system design, performance optimization, and mentoring senior engineers.", "total_experience": 14.0, "relevant_experience": 5.0, "highest_education": "B.Tech in Computer Science", "relevant_education": "Yes", "matching_skills": ["Python", "FastAPI", "Django", "AsyncIO", "AWS", "Kubernetes", "System design", "API architecture"], "missing_skills": ["Experience with OpenAI APIs or similar LLM providers", "Experience with prompt engineering and structured outputs", "Familiarity with Pydantic or schema-based validation", "Experience with RAG systems and vector databases", "Familiarity with LangChain or similar orchestration frameworks", "Exposure to LLM evaluation and monitoring"], "recommendation": "Recommended", "reasoning": "Arjun Mehta has 14 years of total experience in backend engineering, which exceeds the required experience for the role. His skills in Python, FastAPI, AsyncIO, and AWS are relevant to the job description, and he possesses strong system design and API architecture knowledge. However, there are specific skills listed in the job description, such as experience with OpenAI APIs and prompt engineering, that he lacks. This indicates a gap in direct experience with GenAI systems, which may impact his ability to fulfill the exact requirements of the role. Therefore, he is recommended for consideration but may need to ramp up on certain GenAI-specific skills."}
