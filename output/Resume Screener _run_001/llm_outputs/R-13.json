{"resume_id": "R-13", "name": "Laura Martin", "summary": "Data scientist working on predictive models.", "total_experience": 6.0, "relevant_experience": 0.0, "highest_education": "M.Sc in Data Science", "relevant_education": "Yes", "matching_skills": ["Python"], "missing_skills": ["FastAPI", "Django", "OpenAI APIs", "prompt engineering", "Pydantic", "scalable backend systems", "system design", "API architecture", "RAG systems", "vector databases", "LangChain", "async programming", "AWS", "Docker", "Kubernetes", "LLM evaluation and monitoring"], "recommendation": "Not Recommended", "reasoning": "While Laura has a background in data science and possesses strong skills in Python, her experience is primarily focused on predictive modeling rather than backend engineering or GenAI applications. The job description requires extensive hands-on experience with FastAPI, backend systems, and LLM technologies, which are areas in which she lacks experience. Therefore, although she has relevant education in Data Science, the specific skills and experience for this role do not align with her profile."}
